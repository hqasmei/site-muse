This `Dockerfile` is located in the `docker/next/` directory and is used specifically for the Next.js application in the project. 

# **Overview**

This Dockerfile utilizes a multi-stage build process. In a multi-stage build, you use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` statement can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image.

Multi-stage builds are useful to anyone who has struggled to optimize Dockerfiles while keeping them easy to read and maintain.

# **Breakdown of the Dockerfile**

Below is a line-by-line explanation of each part of the `Dockerfile`.

```Dockerfile
# ---- Build Stage ----
FROM node:18.16.0-alpine AS builder
```

This is the first stage of the multi-stage build. It uses the `node:18.16.0-alpine` Docker image as the base image. This image includes Node.js based on the 18.16.0 version and uses Alpine, a lightweight Docker image. The stage is named `builder`.

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

Set the working directory to `/app`. All the instructions that follow in the `Dockerfile` will be run from this directory.

```Dockerfile
COPY package*.json ./
```

Copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if available) from your host to your image filesystem.

```Dockerfile
RUN npm install
```

Run the `npm install` command inside your image filesystem which installs the dependencies described in `package.json`.

```Dockerfile
COPY . .
```

Copy everything from the current directory in your host to the `WORKDIR` in your image filesystem.

```Dockerfile
RUN npm run build
```

This step will create an optimized production build of your Next.js application.

```Dockerfile
# ---- Release Stage ----
FROM node:18.16.0-alpine AS release
```

This begins the second stage of the multi-stage build, also using `node:18.16.0-alpine` as the base image, named as `release`.

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

Sets the working directory to `/app`.

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
```

This copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if available) from the `builder` stage to the current stage.

```Dockerfile
RUN npm install --only=production
```

This will install only the dependencies needed for running the application, and not the devDependencies, thus creating a leaner image.

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
```

These lines are copying the built Next.js app files and the public files from the `builder` stage into the `release` stage.

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
```

This informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. In this case, it's port 3000.

```Dockerfile
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Provides defaults for executing a container, which includes the specifications of what executable to run when the container starts.

In conclusion, this Dockerfile leverages the multi-stage build feature to create a lean, production-ready Docker image of your Next.js application. You start with a larger image containing everything needed to build your application, and then copy just the built application and its runtime dependencies into a smaller, final image.
